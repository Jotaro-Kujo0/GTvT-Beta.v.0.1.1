GTvT-Beta.v.0.1.1 (Göz Tarama ve Tedavi)
I made this system for a Tübitak competition. İts a basic learning machine system for eye dieases recognition.

İt works via device I made but it can be altered too.
The system takes the patients eye scan and compares it to its memory to find any diseases.
it different for pressure related diseases though. It takes readings from data made by another machine or taken by the machinne Im making.
it was trained with open sources that I will list at the end.

it was first made for diabetic retinopathy but it was also trained for the diseases below:

1.diabetic retinopathy (and its stages)

2.cataract

3.myopic

4.astigmatism

5.corneal scars 

6.Glaucoma (by pressure testing)

İt is the first version afterall, so it would have few issues etc.
İt would mean alot if people can give advise and ways to improve

the sources I use:
Tenser flow and similar sites.(for machine training)
EyePACS
ISBI 2019 cataract dataset
Local hospital photo archives (private)
Kaggle sites
I will add on to this as I make new versions.

NOTE!!!!!!!!
I made this system to work with a device in mind
so if you want to use this project for anything, please contact me privately
You may need to alrter slot of things

Have a nice experience :)
